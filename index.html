	  <p><b>Abstract:</b>
	  We demonstrate conTTS, a novel text-to-speech synthesizer based on the open-source continuous vocoder. It provides a powerful set of continuous parameters, including the vocal tract, pitch, and maximum voiced frequency. We aim to gather a high quality synthesized speech. The conTTS design and performance are interactive and do not require any special skills, while being faster than neural network vocoders used in state-of-the art TTS systems. The developed system supports a preliminary evaluation on male and female English speakers, that could assist people with speech disorders. The software to be demonstrated automates the whole procedure from preprocessing to synthesis.
